The **S2TLD: Small Traffic Light Dataset** is the authors newly collected and annotated traffic light dataset. The scenes cover a variety of lighting, weather and traffic conditions, including busy street scenes inner-city, dense stop-and-go traffic, strong changes in illumination/exposure, flickering/fluctuating traffic lights, multiple visible traffic lights, images parts that can be confused with traffic lights.

## Motivation

Small and cluttered objects are common in real-world which are challenging for detection. The difficulty is further pronounced when the objects are rotated, as traditional detectors often routinely locate the objects in horizontal bounding box such that the region of interest is contaminated with background or nearby interleaved objects.

## Dataset description

The S2TLD2 is the authors newly collected and annotated traffic light dataset, which contains 5,786 images of approximately ***1, 080 × 1, 920*** pixels (1,222 images) and ***720 × 1, 280*** pixels (4,564 images). It also contains 5 categories (namely ***red***, ***yellow***, ***green***, ***off*** and ***wait on***) of 14,130 instances. The scenes cover a variety of lighting, weather and traffic conditions, including busy street scenes inner city, dense stop-and-go traffic, strong changes in illumination/exposure, flickering/fluctuating traffic lights, multiple visible traffic lights, image parts that can be confused with traffic lights (e.g. large round tail lights).
