**S<sup>2</sup>TLD: SJTU Small Traffic Light Dataset** is a dataset for an object detection task. It is used in the automotive industry. 

The dataset consists of 5786 images with 14130 labeled objects belonging to 5 different classes including *red*, *green*, *off*, and other: *wait on* and *yellow*.

Images in the S2TLD dataset have bounding box annotations. There are 3 (0% of the total) unlabeled images (i.e. without annotations). There are no pre-defined <i>train/val/test</i> splits in the dataset. Alternatively, the dataset could be split into 2 normal: ***normal 2*** (3785 images) and ***normal 1*** (779 images), or into 2 resolution: ***720x1280*** (4564 images) and ***1080x1920*** (1222 images). The dataset was released in 2022 by the Shanghai Jiao Tong University, China and Anhui University, China.
